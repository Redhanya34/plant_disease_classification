# plant_disease_classification
In this project, i have created a cnn model which will predict whether the plant is sufferring from a disease or not. i have used different layers and hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classification model also used tensorflow and keras for this project

This project is done in google collab notebook.

Steps for this plant disease classificaion problem:

1. Need to mount the data in Google Collab
2. Visualize the data that are used for the working process
3. Find the Mean for all the images and resizing all the other images accordingly
4. Converting the imges into a numpy array and normlize them
5. Check for the imblance
6. Split the data into train and test set and perform one-hot encoding
7. Creating the Model Architecture, Compiling the model and then fitting it
8. Ploting the Accuracy and Loss against each epoch
9. Preprocessing the Test data and then making Predictions on it
10. Visualizing the Original and Predicted labels for the Test image
    
Through these steps we can able to predit the plant diseases. this project will be helpful for the farmers because it says whether the plant is affected or not through this a farmer can make decision to which pesticide has to used or how a farmer can earn profit in this yeild?
